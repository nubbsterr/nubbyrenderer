# What is nubbyyrenderer? 
'nubbyrenderer' is a project based off of sslot's TinyRenderer project, written in C++. As of today (12/18/2024), my goal with this project is to: 1) Understand the original code provided by Dmitry V. Sokolov (ssloy), and 2) to add documentation and my own additions to the project as I see fit.

Such additions have not been laid out yet, as I will most likely derive a list of such once I have finished 'creating' this project. Do note that the original code is NOT MINE, but is of Dmitry V. Sokolov. All credit belongs to him for making this wicked project :)
