# What is nubbyyrenderer? 
**'nubbyrenderer'** is a project based off of ssloy's **TinyRenderer** project, written in C++. As of today (12/18/2024), my goal with this project is to: 

1) Understand the original code provided by Dmitry V. Sokolov (ssloy)
2) To add documentation and my own additions to the project as I see fit.

Such additions have not been laid out yet, as I will most likely derive a list of such once I have finished 'creating' this project. Do note that **the original code is NOT MINE**; it is of Dmitry V. Sokolov. **All credit belongs to him for making this wicked project :)**
